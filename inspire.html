        <h1>My Parents: The True Definition of a Hero</h1>
        
        <h2>Why are my parents my heroes?</h2>
        <p>To me. my parents are the perfect example/definition of a hero.</p>
        <p>The reason that I admire these two marvelous and beautiful people, is because they are the best role models ever.</p>
        <p>Coming from a beautiful little town in Chihuahua, Mexico, they came to the U.S. not knowing the language or having many family members here.</p>
        <p>They gave my two older brothers and I, the best life.</p>
        <p>While they were not given the opportunity to attend college, they always motivated us to go to college and get a career.</p>
        <p>My parents sacrificed many things just,so that we could have what we wanted.</p>
        <p>They are one of the top reasons, that I decided to pursue another degree after graduating with a Bachelor's in Biology.</p>
        <p>I was given the luxury of being able to become a software engineering major, and that is all thanks to them.</p>
        <p>Without their help, I probably would have been able to do it.</p>
        <p>I am beyond blessed to not only call these people my parents, but also my <strong><h1><HEROES/h1></strong>.</p>
